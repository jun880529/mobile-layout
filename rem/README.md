# rem mobile layout
## rem concept
   - change the font-size of html will change all the element united by rem.
   - default set 20px for 320px psdwidth, the width is 16rem, if width of psd in 640 is 460 ,it rem: (16*460)/640 =11.5rem
   - 16px is also good. because the default font-size of is 16px less than 16px may cause
     trouble for the browser will still set 16px for it like the chrome in android
   - you should also set the max fontSize ,then the max width of your page will be y*16px
